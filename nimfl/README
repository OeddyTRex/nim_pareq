README file for NIMFL, 12/11/18

NIMFL is a field-line tracer and poloidal power decomposer for NIMROD, 
written by Tom Gianakon and Carl Sovinec.  It uses the standard technique of 
integrating individual field line equations.  The formulation is general,
except for cases with nulls in the total field and the implementation 
works for both rblocks and tblocks.   Poloidal power is limited to
regions of closed n=0 magnetic field which is determined by numerical
integration of the n=0 magnetic field.

The input parameters are listed in input.f and input0.f.  The input.f
is the standard nimrod.in data file, so this file is now required to
run nimfl on an input file. The second input file (nimfl.in) controls the
functioning of nimfl itself.  The code can perform three tasks
based on the input variable "task":  "poincare" sections,
"poloidal" power decompostion, and "ntm" or analytic neoclassical tearing
mode stability analysis.  The user has additional flexibility in
the choice of starting positions for field line integrations, that
are controlled by the "poincare_positions" input variable.  These
are "read" the contents of start_positions.dat (1st entry is number of
data and (R,Z) position on each subsequent line.); "qval" uses
the n=0 q-profile to pick rational surfaces based on toroidal mode number nn;
"cell" positions uses logical coordinates from the magnetic axis to the 
boundary along one ray; and "axis" positions uses uniform spaced postions
from the magnetic axis to the outboard closed surface (theta = 0.)

Evaluation calls and array indices have been changed for elements with
user-chosen polynomial degree.  Note that poly_degree must be set to
match what is used for the computation.  [Dump_read should complain if
it isn't.]

The quadratic branch is merged into the main trunk.

  CRS, 6/27/00

Introduction of dump_reset map to allow field line integration with
rblocks and tblocks.   Flexibility for starting positions added
of field line integration added.  Poloidal power decompostion
of magnetic energy added.  Dropped poly_degree from nimfl.in since
the nimrod.in file is now read.  The dump_file is still controlled
from nimfl.in.

The periodic selection included by Tom has been changed to use the
input read from nimrod.in, rather than doing a separate check for
periodicity.  The frac_step variable has been returned to input to
help users avoid problematic map inversions.  Finally, when a field
line leaves the domain, lsode is told that B=(0,0,1) to avoid an
integration hang.

The minimum step size for Poincare plotting has been lowered to avoid
lsode errors and balks.

  The makefile structure has been changed to place all device-specific
information in the make.inc files in the new make_includes directory.

  CRS, 6/19/03

  The field-line trace has been modified for rectangular meshes with
periodic top-to-bottom boundaries.  The plane-crossing search is not
perfect in these cases but seems to work well if the desired plane is
not close the periodic boundary.
  The tolerance for crossing the plotting plane is now an input
parameter.

  nimuw3_4_9

  This version has the makefile revised for the new data organization
with common modules and objects located in the nimcore directory.

  CRS, 9/9/15

  Modifications to let nimfl use parallel computing are being added.
Parallel decomposition is not sophisticated, it just divies the
starting points evenly among the processors, regardless of how long
each trace takes to compute.  Also, each processor writes a separate
file.  The user then needs to perform 'cat nimfl*bin > nimfl.bin' to
concatenate them into a single file.

  CRS, 7/2/18

  We now link odepack as an external library.  The build links to the
library that is specified in the make.inc file instead of compiling
source code within the nimrod directory.  The only change in NIMFL
coding is that the driver routine for double precision is named dlsode
and not lsode.
