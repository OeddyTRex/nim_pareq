  program nimplot:  Version (nimuw) 3_4_12  8/16/16

  NIMPLOT is an interactive routine for generating graphics from NIMROD
restart files.  Some of the output options (XDRAW and DX binary files,
for example) can be generated directly from NIMROD and were first
implemented there.  The motivation for creating a separate program was
parallel computation.  At present NIMROD does not do true parallel io,
all io goes through a single processor.  Because this is a complicated
procedure, the restart dump routines are the only io routines that write
spatially dependent data when running in parallel.  This led to the need
for a program like NIMPLOT.  Having this postprocessing capability
gives one more graphical flexibility after completing a simulation, too.
There also exists an input-file driven postprocessor, ANALYZE, written
by Alan Glasser.
  The interactive instructions are intended to be sufficient to step
a user through the different input levels.  A user is able to select
different plot types, dump files, Fourier modes or toroidal angles
(nonlinear runs only) through NIMPLOT dialogue.  However, the draw*.in
files for driving XDRAW are still needed.  NIMPLOT will help you find
an appropriate draw*.in file when plotting XDRAW graphics directly, but
you may still need to edit the draw*.in file to display some particular
components of a vector.  Each draw*.in file contains 1) a plot type,
2) binary file name(s), 3) a list of data in the binary file, and 
4) a list of plots to be drawn.  Sometimes, plotting a desired component
is only a matter of inserting or deleting the comment indicator ';' in
the first column of a plot list entry.
  Good luck, and feedback on using NIMPLOT (not XDRAW) is welcome.  Send
me e-mail at sovinec@lanl.gov.

  Bug fixes:

  In the data_rep subroutine in nimplot.f, I have eliminated the
nonadvancing read to prevent being kicked out of the loop prematurely.
I don't know what was wrong with the old coding, and it may be a
compiler error on the SGI IRIX64.  Nonadvancing writes throughout the
file have also been changed to the F90 standard.

   Carl Sovinec, 8/27/98


   Flux surface quantities:

  A new subroutine, fl_surface, is added to diagnose.f in the nimset
directory and is used by nimplot.  It produces a contour plot of
poloidal flux surfaces using equilibrium and n=0 fields (for nonlinear
cases).  It also finds q and parallel current=mu0*J.B/B**2 again using
equilibrium and n=0 fields.

  Version 2_2_6 (using nimrod cvs revision number)

  This revision incorporates many changes in order to make nimplot
more useful and more flexible:

1) Creating derived quantities is now possible through finite element
computations.  Nimplot now uses many of nimrod's modules, such as
rblock, tblock, generic_evals, computation_pointers, etc.  Computing
vertex quantities is done by simple division of the lumped-mass, and
boundary and regularity conditions are not applied.  The management
routines for the computations are in nimplot_mgt.f, and the integrand
routines are in nimplot_ints.  The following new plots (new to
nimplot, at least) use these computations:

 a) current density--this is always computed for the standard solution
plots such as xy_slices, x&yt_slices, and contour_plots.

 b) energy spectra--reproduces an energy.bin file using the same
drawen.in as with the nimrod output; however, data is taken from a
dump file list.

 c) div(b) contours--from a dump file list.

 d) local contour plots of mu0*J.B/B**2.

Users may add other computations in a fashion similar to what is done
in the physics kernel:  Add another input option to the main nimplot
program (following single-file or file-list format), then add
appropriate management and integrand routines.

2) The separate rb_read and tb_read structures have been eliminated in
plot_data.  Individual Fourier component indices are passed to the
diagnose routines instead of making single-component structures.
Thus, the diagnose.f file used in nimplot is unique.  The flux-surface
quantities have been eliminated from the nimset file, since they are
no longer needed there.  The dump_read routine is just the normal
nimset version.  An additional benefit is that eliminating the *_read
structures alleviates the trouble with the t3e f90 compiler.  Data
deallocation routines are now part of plot_data, and deallocates are
done in acquire_data before a new file is read.

3) Vector plots of the data are a new option.  The data file is the
same as for a contour plot, though conversion to flux-surface
(grid-surface, really) components is not permitted.  A drawvec.in is
in the draw directory.

  CRS, 2/19/99


  Version 2_3_2

  An option to plot <E>.<J> has been added, where <> indicates
Fourier-direction average.  The <E> is broken into mhd and Hall
contributions, and individual toroidal components may be selected for
the correlation.
  Equilibrium fields may now be added to the n=0 solution for data
plots of the n=0 component.  Previously, equilibrium fields could only
be added to plots in configuration space.

  CRS, 5/26/99

  A call to tri_linear_get_areas has been added in acquire_data to
initialize the tblock tgeom structure every time a new dump file is
read.  This fixes problems with tblock computations.

  CRS, 6/25/99

  Fixed nimplot_mgt to use 'c' not 'd' for computation flags and created
a separate data_rep message for correlations.

  CRS 6/26/99


  Version 2_3_3

  The new seam ordering used for block-border vertex communication is
being carried-over to nimplot.  The only border initialization needed
by nimplot is now in module edge in the new edge_init routine located
in file edge.f.  The old ptr2_init and edge_init in nimplot_init.f
have been removed.

  CRS, 8/13/99

  Another xy-slice file option has been added, which writes poloidal
flux and its root to be used as independent variables.

  CRS, 8/25/99


  Version 2_3_4

  The tecplot_mod module has been added to convert binary xdraw output
to ascii tecplot plt files after viewing with xdraw.  Coding has also
been added to loop over the periodic coordinate to create 3D data at a
given time for tecplot.  An option to convert vector components to
Cartesian permits toroidal shaped plots with appropriate vectors.
  Also, plots in configuration space have been modified to use a sum
over Fourier components directly, like Tom's code in nimfl, intead of
using FFTs, since data at every grid point is not needed.

  CRS, 2/25/00


  quadratic branch:

1.  Diagnose has been updated for the complex version of data with
expanded basis functions, like the diagnose module in nimset.  The
flux-surface based computations now work with the global arrays
generated by struct_set to handle higher-order elements automatically.

2.  Contour has some preliminary changes for complex data, but it does
not yet plot data associated with bases of poly degree > 1.

3.  The routines in nimplot_init.f have been modified for the new data
and matrix types (for the lumped mass matrix, which isn't
appropriate--we'll need a matrix solve of the real mass matrix).
  The convenience pointer assignments are now done with routines in
vector_type_mod to automatically handle the different basis types.
  A boundary_init routine, similar to what's in nimrod_init, has been
added, since segment communication is now used in nimplot.

4.  The nimplot_ints module has been modified for the new data type
and basis function evaluations.

5.  Modifications to nimplot_mgt are underway.  The routines will need
to solve the actual mass matrix, not just divide by the lumped mass,
with our nonstandard basis functions.

6.  Plot_data has been modified for the new basis function sets and
deallates.  The fields_at_angle, add_eq_fields, and flux_comps
routines now treat all basis functions.

  CRS, 9/23/99

7.  The vector-component index is now the first of the arrays indices
for bicubes, lagrange quadrilaterals, tri_linears, and vector type
arrays.  This has been done for optimizing nimrod and is not germane
to the change in basis functions.

  CRS, 9/24/99

8.  The contour_mod module has been updated for the generalized basis
functions in rblocks.  New routines for writing data from passed
structures have been added, so that that operation may be easily done
from the nimplot management routines as well as from contour step.

9.  Nimplot_init now creates and saves distributed mass matrices
instead of lumped masses.  It also calls routines for the partial
factorization of the mass matrices for preconditioning during
iterative solves.

10. The nimplot management routines have been updated for calling the
iterative solver for the distributed mass matrix.  They also generate
contour plots with the additional data needed for order>=2 elements in
rblocks.

11. A generic eval_at_angle routine has been added to plot_data for
use by the management routines (for plots of computed quantities at an
angle).

12. A dummy parallel_io.f has been added, and pardata.f is now linked
to the real pardata in nimrod.

  CRS, 10/5/99

13. Diagnose has been updated to write REAL(4), even on the T3E.

14. The complex 2D vector types are now used in the matrix solves for
the solution and rhs vectors.

  CRS, 10/26/99

15. With the conversion to standard Lagrange elements, lumping the
mass matrix is again possible, and the lump_all option in the input
file controls which mass matrix is used (lumped or distributed).

  CRS, 11/22/99

16. Index order of side and interior centered arrays has been changed
so that the basis index is second.

  CRS, 6/9/00


  3_0

  The quadratic branch is being merged into the main trunk at 2_3_4.

  CRS, 6/28/00

  The acquire_data routine has been modified so that jfromb is called
only for the data plots that need J and only for the requested Fourier
components.  This helps reduce the time to bring up a plot.
  READ and WRITE statements have been changed to use nim_rd and nim_wr
unit numbers intead of "*".  This complies with an old programming
standard.

  CRS, 6/30/00

  The computation of poloidal flux for xy slice plots has been
incorrect when the user selects flux components.  The transformation
occurs first, then the poloidal flux function is computed assuming r,
z components.  To correct this, the flux function computation for
these plots now uses what is in the work1 array, since that is set to
the cylindrical components of be for the computation of current
density.

NOTE: THERE ARE MANY OPTIONS (ADD EQ FIELDS, FLUX COMPS, TOROIDAL
ANGLE INSTEAD OF N, ETC.) THAT MUST NOT INTERFERE FOR DATA-TYPE PLOTS
(SLICES AND CONTOUR/VECTOR PLOTS).  THIS MAKES THE PLOT_DATA CODING
PRETTY INFLEXIBLE, SO PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN MODIFYING IT.

  The equilibrium diffusivity shape function has been added to slice
and contour/vector plot files and draw*.in files.

  The bicube set calls in nimplot_init.f are now done only for data
needed in specific nimplot_int routines.  Also, bicube cmat arrays are
deallocated after calls to bicube_all_eval in diagnose and contour to
help save memory.

  CRS, 9/28/00


  3_0_1

  Changes have been made to be consistent with the new quadrature
point storage for the physics kernel.  During initialization, the
bicube_save routine has been removed (bicubic spline interpolates are
computed on the fly), and integrands have been updated for the single
quadrature point index of bases.  The qp storage is not used, as it is
assumed that most data is used only once when running nimplot.  This
also avoids increasing memory requirements.

  CRS, 4/10/01

  3_0_3

  The bl_seam_dealloc routine in plot_data is being fixed to
deallocate all parts of the seam that are allocated in nimplot and to
deallocate seam0.

  CRS, 8/22/01

  3_1

  Basic data plots for the separate electron and ion temperatures have
been added without removing the pressure plots.

  CRS, 11/20/01

  A diagnostic for computing the heat flux vector separated into
parallel and perpendicular contributions has been added.  At present
the computation uses Te only, but this will be updated to include Ti
soon.

  CRS, 2/03/02

  The jfromb call in plot_data has been moved to preceed the call to
add_eq_fields, so that we do not find the curl of equilibrium magnetic
field with a finite element solve.

  CRS, 4/30/02

  uw3_1_1map branch

  Updates for the elimination of bicubic splines (RZ map and
equilibrium quantities) are being added.  In most cases, it is just a
matter of replacing bicube_eval calls with lagr_quad_eval calls.

  CRS, 3/13/03

  nimuw 3_1_2

  Modifications from uw3_1_1map have been merged into the main trunk.

  CRS, 5/8/03

  nimuw3_2

  Commonly used modules have been moved to the nimlib libarary.  The
makefile have been changed to access nimlib.
 
  CRS, 5/15/03

  Two long-standing bugs are being fixed in plot_data:

1) Scott K. caught an error with the mode number range not being set
for all plotting options.  

2) be_eq is added to work1 in add_eq_fields, so that the slice plots
vs. poloidal flux appear correctly after the be_eq arrays are
zeroed-out.  work1 is not used for anything else in 'data' plots, so
this shouldn't cause other problems.

  CRS, 6/17/03

  The preconditioning option "gl_diaga" has been hard-wired into
nimplot, so that nimplot does not need to link any external libraries,
regardless of the 'solver' option in the nimrod.in file.
  The makefile structure has been changed to place all device-specific
information in the make.inc files in the new make_includes directory.

  CRS, 6/19/03


  nimuw3_2_1

  The cg solvers need the new iter_utils module, so the nimplot
Makefile had to be modified to add a link and to compile the fortran
file.  The symmetric flag for the mass matrices has also been set in
nimplot_init.f.

  CRS, 9/10/03  


  nimuw3_2_2

  Plots of magnetic divergence and current density computed from the
gradients of magnetic field within elements are now available through
output written directly for Tecplot.  [There can be no intermediate
xdraw step here.]  This work was done by Dan Swanson this past summer,
and subsequently expanded to allow for multiple Fourier components.

  CRS, 12/6/03


  nimuw3_2_4

  The seam deallocation in plot_data always tried to deallocate
excorner in the seam0 structure, but it's not allocated for doubly
periodic systems.  This has been corrected.
  The heat-flux diagnostic has been modified to accommodate
temperature-dependent coefficients and to add a convective heat flux
plot.  However, it has only been written for single-temperature
computations (separate_pe=F) so far.

  CRS, 9/3/04


  post-nimuw3_2_5 tag

  There is a correction to the poloidal flux plot which makes the
surface-normal directions consistent between horizontal grid-line
integrations and vertical grid-line integrations.  This affected the
computation for the option 7 plot only.
  The e_dot_j integrand routine has been modified to include
temperature-dependent resistivity.  However, only the variation of <T>
is considered, even if eta_model="full".

  CRS, 5/6/05

  Element-based dynamo diagnostics have been added.  The output is
intended for tecplot only.

  CRS, 2/10/07

  The xlog utility has been modified to be more reliable in deciding
whether to start a new block of records.

  CRS, 6/14/07

  The energy_density integrand has been updated to use the computations
for evolving number density that have been in the diagnostic integrand
for the kernel.

  CRS, 7/3/07


  pre-nimuw3_3_7 tag

  There has been a little bit of reorganization to facilitate reuse
of code by the NIMEQ program.  The new source file plot_io.f contains
the routines xdraw_plot, data_rep, acuire_dump_name, and
acquire_dump_list, which used to be in nimplot.f.  Also, data
deallocation has been moved out of plot_data.f and into data_dealloc.f
so that NIMEQ can use the rest of plot_data and have its own
data deallocation routines.

  CRS, 10/23/08

  The energy_density diagnostics have been revised again.  Though not
exactly the same as the energy computation from the physics kernel, the
computations in the nimplot routine now follow the same logic.

  The integrand routines have been modified for the quadrature-point
reordering that is presently in the qpreord_from_335hpyd branch.  The
summation associated with quadrature-point integration is performed
in each of the integrand routines, and the 'ix' index is now the quad-pt
index, while 'iy' is the element index.

  CRS, 7/6/09

  The integrand routines have minor changes to accommodate the
modifications for discontinuous fields in nimrod.

  CRS, 11/19/13

  A new option for computing and displaying the ion acoustic speed,
Mach number, and normalized parallel flow have been added.  The option
is intended for nonlinear computations, but if it is used for linear
computations, it will display information computed from the
equilibrium fields.

  KJB and CRS, 6/23/15

  nimuw3_4_9

  This version has the makefile revised for the new data organization
with common modules and objects located in the nimcore directory.

  CRS, 9/9/15

  The tecplot_mod file has been moved into nimlib, where a new vtk_mod
module and an eldata_type_mod have been added.  Using the new vtk
module, the xdraw binary conversion step can go directly to vtk format
instead of tecplot format.  The new eldata structures also facilitate
writing discontinuous fields (such as the element-divb, j, and dynamo
fields) in either tecplot or vtk format.  The respective routines in
nimplot_mgt now load the eldata structures and call the respective
writing routine, instead of writing tecplot-only format.

  CRS, 8/16/16
