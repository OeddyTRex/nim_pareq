  program nimeq (anewt):  Version (nimuw) 3_5, 1/2/19

** This is the approximate-Newton version of NIMEQ, which is described
in my team meeting presentation from April 2, 2016.  Besides the
appr.-Newt parts, themselves, the algebraic relations are structured
for changes to the solution, with the right sides being residual
vectors.  If it weren't for the appr.-Newton computations, this
formulation is cleaner than the standard formulation.
  It is being committed, because some cases converge better with this
formulation than with the standard formulation, even when the
approximate-Newton terms are not used.  **

  We now link odepack as an external library.  The build links to the
library that is specified in the make.inc file instead of compiling
source code within the nimrod directory.

  Eric Howell's implementation of the Jardin feedback scheme is being
added to nimuw.  It has separate vertical and radial feedback based
on pairs of sensor points.  Each uses a PID controller that adjusts
current in a specified set of feedback coils.  This supersedes the old
horizontal feedback coils, which are now removed.
  These modifications have been ported to the appr-Newton version of
NIMEQ, so that the code will compile, but the option has not been
tested.  Further development will be needed for including this
feedback in the appr-Newton steps.
