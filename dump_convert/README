README file for DUMP_CONVERT:  Version 3_4_11  9/10/16

This program converts dump files for the linear-element-only code
(nimrod2_*) into dump files for the generalized quadrilateral basis
form (nimrod3_1_*).  It's interactive, requiring only the name of the
old dump file and a name for the new dump file.

  The makefile structure has been changed to place all device-specific
information in the make.inc files in the new make_includes directory.

  The Makefile has been changed to link source files from their new
location in the nimcore directory.  The dump_convert executables do
not use the nimcore libraries, however.
